   The hpp-util library gathers technical tools for the HPP project.

   This package does not target specifically path planning or robotics.

   It provides:
   - logging mechanisms (different channels are linked to several outputs).
   - benchmark tools
   - quality assurance tools (contract programming tools
     and "smart" assertions).

   The Doxygen documentation has been written to be a reference document.
   For tutorials and more user-friendly documentation, see the
   <a href="http://github.com/laas/hpp-util/wiki">hpp-util wiki</a>.

   Bug reporting can be done through the
   <a href="http://github.com/laas/hpp-util/issues">github ticketing
   system</a>.
